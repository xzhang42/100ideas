1.I have always been curious and interested in CG because, in my spare time, I usually play some video games called 3A, which means that the games are invested a lot of time, money and resources. For example, CD Projekt Red, a game called cyberpunk2077, will be launched soon by it. All the scenes and characters in the game or science fiction movies are really real, which is likely to be applied to motion capture and other technologies. 

2.For virtual reality technology, people can experience the most real feelings in the real world. The authenticity of its simulation environment and the real world are difficult to distinguish the true and the false, which makes people have a kind of immersive feeling. I haven't tried using VR devices, so I've always been curious about it.

3.3D modeling is applied to many aspects, such as animation, games, architecture. The requirements are fine, colorful, high-quality and complex models.

4.The autonomous vehicle is a car that surprises me and is very uneasy. I may not use it all my life, because I always think it will suddenly fail. However, I'm curious about the technology it contains.

5.Some time ago, I saw a story on the news about a high paralyzed patient who used an instrument to help him drink coke. Did the patient use his mind to control it? I'm not sure, but it's really confusing and a headache for me. How is this technology achievedï¼Ÿ

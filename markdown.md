The Internet is a very amazing thing, it can do almost anything for people. Like me, if my life is off the Internet, I may have a hard time living. People create networks, and networks serve people.
Anything that appears in science fiction movies that I've seen or that we fantasize about now may become a reality because of the Internet.
